# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow, fast = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False

# Time complexity: O(n) 
# Where n is the total number of nodes in the linked list. 

# Space complexity: O(1) 
# We only use two nodes (slow and fast) so the space complexity is O(1).
